    question: 'Why do I need to connect both an Ethereum and a Cardano wallet?',

    answer:
      'The total tokens for year 1 of the loyalty rewards is 8,293,398 AGIX. These are proportionally distributed among all token holders during the hardfork snapshot, in six monthly allocations. So it all depends on your balance during the hardfork.',
